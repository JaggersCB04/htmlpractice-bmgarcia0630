   <p> My name is Breanna and I like and dislike a lot of things. I love dogs and also love writing. 
   I dislike bullies and sharks. <del>Im also in all honors but math isn't really my strong suit.</del> 
   I get really embarressed by going up infront of class or even talking in front of a group of people. <!--About me in a paragraph with the 4th paragraph crossed out-->
